What Is It?
I'm "reviving" the Demae-Can app for Wii U. Well... not really. 
Right now I'm just remaking the UI. 
Depending on if I gain more knowledge in web development I might turn it into an actual revival. 
Maybe fake ordering or real restaurants, who knows?

Have an issue or want to make edits to the code? Post an issue or a pull request!
Thanks!
